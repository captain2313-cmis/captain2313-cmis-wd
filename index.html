					Lists and Links
				</h3>
				<p>
					This assignment introduces the use of lists in html coding. It shows how ordered lists and unordered lists are used in a webpage.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Create a new folder called "listsandlinks" in your repository folder.
					</li>
					<li>
						Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file called "main.css"
					</li>
					<li>
						In index.html create an ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage on the production server.
					</li>
					<li>
						Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with useful webdesign related information.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the nav section, create an unordered list of links with a link back to your main index page.
					</li>
					<li>
						In your main index.html file in public_html, add an unordered list of links to the nav section with a link to "listsandlinks".
					</li>
					<li>
						In your old index.html, add an article with a heading and a paragraph description of this assignment. Also add an unordered list that contains this list of requirements. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Turn in your work.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>
					Tables
				</h3>
				<p>
					This Assignment gives me an idea of how tables are made using html coding. The tables seems to be fully customizable.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Create a new folder in your repository called "tables"
					</li>
					<li>
						In the "tables" folder, create a new file called from your template "index.html"
					</li>
					<li>
						Be sure to use thead, tbody, and tfoot elements in your tables.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add html code to recreate the webpage below.
						<ul>
							<li>
								second table will require the use of the colspan attribute.
							</li>
							<li>
								third table will require the use of the rowspan attribute.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						In your repository index.html file, add an article with a heading, paragraph description and this list of requirements. Also add a link to the tables/index.html file. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Add a link from lists and links to this assignment as well.
					</li>
					<li>
						Validate your code.
					</li>
					<li>
						Turn it in.
					</li>
				</ul>
