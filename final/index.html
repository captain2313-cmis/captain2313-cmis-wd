					Description of Company
				</h3>
				<p>
					The Chiang Mai International School(CMIS) Pencil Shop was founded by a Nakornpayap International School(NIS) student Bulakorn Thawornrunggit(Captain) who recently(2012) enrolled CMIS to manage the shop easier. The shop is associated with the main stationary store of CMIS but does not have a physical office. Since year 2000, the office has been recieving complaints and reports about stolen and lost pencils from all primary, elementary, and secondary school. This shop was intended to ease the students with an easy access of pencils at a low price due to mass production.
